# C-Shenron: A Realistic Radar Simulator for End-to-End Autonomous Driving in CARLA
This repository contains the official implementation used for the paper "A Realistic Radar Simulator for End-to-End Autonomous Driving in CARLA". The simulator is designed to generate realistic radar data for autonomous driving tasks, enhancing the capabilities of the CARLA simulator.

## Overview
C-Shenron is a high-fidelity radar simulation framework integrated with the CARLA simulator, enabling realistic, physics-based radar data generation using LiDAR and camera inputs. It supports customizable radar sensor setups and generates data suitable for End-to-End (E2E) autonomous driving pipelines, especially for transformer-based models like Transfuser++.

Key features:
- Realistic radar data using physics-based Shenron model
- Supports multiple radar views (Front, Back, Left, Right)
- End-to-end integration with imitation learning pipelines
- Easily scalable data collection and evaluation setup
- Demonstrated performance gains over LiDAR-camera baselines (+3% Driving Score)

## Data Collection
First we need to generate bash scripts for both starting carla simulator and data collection. `data_generation_bash_scripts.py` will generate the scripts into `Data_Collection_Scripts` directory which has two sub-folders:
1. `Start_Carla_Job_Scripts` contains scripts to start carla simulator and run the data collection scripts
2. `Job_Files` contains the data collection scripts

#### Generating scripts:
```shell
python3 data_generation_bash_scripts.py
```

#### To start data collection
```shell
bash Data_Collection_Scripts/Start_Carla_Job_Scripts/job0.sh
```
This is an example, you can run any of the files from `bash Data_Collection_Scripts/Start_Carla_Job_Scripts`.

Refer to [parallelization.md](./parallelization.md) in this repository for instructions on how to run data collection scripts in parallel by executing each script in a separate pod.

#### Downloading the dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: [http://wcsng-41.nrp-nautilus.io:8000/](http://wcsng-41.nrp-nautilus.io:8000/)

## Training the model
#### Training:
```shell
bash team_code/shell_train.sh
```

Arguments for `team_code/train.py`:
1. `id` - Specifies the sub-directory where the trained model will be stored
2. `continue_epoch` - Use only when you want to use pre-trained model
    - `0` to train from epoch 0
    - `1` to train from epoch where pre-trained model left it
3. `radar_channels` - Select radar from carla or simulation
    - `2` to use carla's front and back radar
    - `<anything else>` to use radar data from SHENRON
4. `radar_cat` - Select the radar concatenation model from SHENRON
    - `1` to use front and back concatenation
    - `2` to use front, back, left and right concatenation
5. `use_radar` - To use radar data for training
6. `use_lidar` - To use lidar data for training

## Evaluation
Similar to data collection, we need to generate bash scripts for both starting carla simulator and data collection.
1. `Evaluation_Scripts/generate_run_bashs.py` generates the bash scripts to start carla simulator and running the evaluation scripts into `Start_Carla_Job_Scripts`
2. `Evaluation_Scripts/evaluation_bash_scripts.py` generates the evaluation scripts into `Job_Files`

You can vary all the evaluation parameters in `evaluation_bash_scripts.py`.

#### Running Evaluations:
```shell
bash /Evaluation_Scripts/Start_Carla_Job_Scripts/job0.sh
```

Again, this is an example and you can run any of the files from the `Start_Carla_Job_Scripts` and parallelize the process by following the above mentioned repository.
